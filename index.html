      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
       <!--  Remember the internet of the 90s and early 2000s? Back then, you could say what you want without fear of "going on a list" or being blackmailed in the future. The only rule was never to reveal your real name or identity. As technical people, we have a duty to bring that internet back and make it the mainstream again.  -->
      We are a bunch of techies and security experts who want to make effective online security accessible to everyone in Brisbane.

      <b>Playing Hard to Get on the Internet</b>
      This event will focus on operational security; successful habits to protect your identity and control what information about you is broadcast to the internet. As well as habits we teach tools that support this, password managers allow you to easily manage multiple accounts, and the tor browser bundle allows you to avoid your accounts being linked together even by sophisticated groups like ASIO, Google or the NSA.
