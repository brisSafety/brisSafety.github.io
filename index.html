        Remember the internet of the 90s and early 2000s? Back then, you could say what you want without fear of "going on a list" or being blackmailed in the future. The only rule was never to reveal your real name or identity. As technical people, we have a duty to bring that internet back and make it the mainstream again. We are a bunch of techies and security experts who want to share our knowledge and make effective online security more accessable in Brisbane.

      <h2>Our Last Event</h2>
      <p>
      Our first event was hosted at the ThoughtWorks office with a special guest, former senator for Queensland and active Greens member, Andrew Bartlett. The night was themed private browsing and devoted to protecting yourself from corporate trackers (facebook, twitter, ad networks) and from mandatory data retention recently introduced in Australia. We got a great mix of people who had no problem in installing the tools and had many interesting conversations throughout the night.

      <p>
      <b>Playing Hard to Get on the Internet</b>
      This event will focus on operational security; successful habbits to protect your identity and control what infromation about you is broadcast to the internet. As well as habbits we teach tools that support this, password managers allow you to easily manage multiple accounts, and the tor browser bundle allows you to avoid your accounts being linked together even by sophisticated groups like ASIO, Google or the NSA.
